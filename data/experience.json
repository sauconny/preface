As a team we were able to leverage vanilla JavaScript, HTML/CSS, jQuery, and also Node.JS to create a web application and a RESTful API hosted in AWS. A dynamic Python script was also implemented to change a LED light connected to a Raspberry Pi to determine what clinical operation was occuring in our web application.
